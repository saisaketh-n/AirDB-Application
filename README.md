# Airline-Database-Application
# Project Goals
The main objective of this project is to create a cohesive set of classes for an object-oriented application. Specifically, the application aims to emulate an airline database system, managing employees such as pilots and attendants, handling flight information, and providing relevant functionalities typical of an airline database.

# Project Description
This project involves the development of classes essential for building an airline database system. The system encompasses the management of employees, including both pilots and attendants, as well as handling flight-related data. The application is designed to deliver fundamental airline database functionalities, with each flight connecting two airports and having an assigned crew.

The project comprises several files, each serving a specific purpose. It is imperative to maintain organization by keeping these files within a designated project folder. Here is a brief overview of each file:
- project4.py :Contains driver code and additional functions to offer a command-line
- employee.py :Defines a class named Employee.
- flight.py :Defines a class named Flight.
- airline.py :Defines a class named Airline.
- master.pkl :Contains a test database in byte/binary form for the airline system
- data.txt :Not directly utilized by the program but displays the data (in textual form) contained in the master.pkl file.
- project4_tests.py :Houses unit tests for the project.
